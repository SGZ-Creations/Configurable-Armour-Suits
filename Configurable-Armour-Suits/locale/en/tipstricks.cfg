configurable-armour-suits=Thanks for using Configurable Armour & Suits.

cas-info=CAS Allows for adjusting:\n* Armour Grids.\n* Inventory bonus(es).\n\n* Image: Shows the default: Vanilla & [space-age] setting alternatives.\nWhile CAS has more mods supported, the settings will only apear if the mod is added. So find your perfect setting and have fun.

par_cas-info=CAS is requires by PA&R, this is done so that the host can adjust settings,\nShould the armour grids and/or INV-Bonus be to big for you.\n\nPAR Hard disables all other compatibility settings that wouldn't be relavant to be used when PAR is active. The reason is that PAR mod will disable the armours from these mods\nThere for the settings that become useless & has no effects will not show up. This is to not bloat the tab with exsessive settings.
